# 🔥 CodeRoast — The AI Code Reviewer With a Grudge

> *"You don’t need a linter. You need therapy."*

**CodeRoast** is a VS Code extension that reads your code, silently judges your life choices,
and then roasts each problematic line with AI-generated insults — powered by Gemini.

It doesn’t ask *“Are you ready for feedback?”*
It asks *“Are you emotionally stable enough to handle this?”*

---

## ⚙️ What It Does

* 🧠 Scans your entire codebase
* 🔎 Sends each file to Gemini AI
* 💬 Returns roast comments for:

  * Logic flaws
  * Naming crimes
  * Empty `catch` blocks
  * Bad style
  * Missing error handling
  * Things that would make your senior dev sigh audibly
* 🩻 Highlights the roast directly in the file via VS Code diagnostics
* 🧾 Generates a `roast-summary.md` in `.code-roast/database/` with:

  * Severity counts
  * Common bad habits
  * Suggested improvements
  * A final report so you can cry productively

## 🔧 Extension Settings

To use CodeRoast with Gemini, you’ll need to provide your own Gemini API key.

Go to **Settings > Extensions > CodeRoast** or open `settings.json` and add:

```json
"codeRoast.geminiApiKey": "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

Optional settings coming soon:

* `codeRoast.useGeminiForSummary`: `true | false` — lets Gemini write the roast summary
* `codeRoast.languageFilter`: `["js", "py", "java"]` — restrict which files get roasted

No key = no roast. Gemini demands tribute.

## 💡 Example

```ts
if (data == null || data == undefined) {
  console.log("oops")
}
```

> *“null == undefined? Did you learn JavaScript from a fortune cookie?”*

```ts
catch {}
```

> *“Ah yes, silent error handling. Nothing to see here. Especially the errors.”*

```ts
const thing = "yolo"
```

> *“Global constant named 'thing'. I weep for future maintainers.”*

No tracking.
No data collection.
Just roasting.

## 🧷 Why?

Because your code is probably bad.
And deep down, you know it.
